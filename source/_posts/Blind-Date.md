Recently, I have tried my first blind date with a girl introduced by my mother's friend, the whole process is truly weird, and finally nothing happened, both me and that girl have no feelings about each other, and..that's it. 

## First Meet

### Before Meeting

It happens when I was attending a wedding in Yunnan Province as a groomsman. That day, I received a phone call from my mother, she said that I need to have a meet with a girl at the day when I came back to Chengdu City. At that moment, I did not decline it, cause, it has been 24 years being single, and I do think that I need to develop a relationship if it is possible. So, before meeting, I have been mentally prepared.

### During Meeting

That night, I followed my parents, accessing into a tea house, with so many people into that small room(so many relatives of that girl and mine), I feel restricted, and being silent. It is so awkward, and I don't know what to talk. Utimately, they free us to get out of tea house to do something interesting, instead of staying in that room, and say nothing, I am so glad, and started to date with that girl in the nearby CBD.

### After Meeting

So firstly, we started to chat with each other in the process of finding a place to drink. About my first impression about that girl? As for that, What I can say is only "Not Bad". Why? Cause, honestly speaking, I have seen the pics about this girl before meeting, and in the photo, she is a bit of fat, especially about her face, and the problem is that I don't like this kind of girl. I am more fond of girl who is thin (not skinny) and has a small face with short hair (prefered, but not absolutely). But after seen her in reality, she is not as fat as I think, and I thought it is bearable temporarily. Finally, we found a place to buy drinks, and started to talk. 

In the first place, we try to talk something about our hometown, cause we do came from the same city, and even started our education in the same school. But these topic is tedious, and it is easy to find nothing to talk. So, I started to ask her what habits she has, what kind of movie she likes to watch, but unfortunately, she is not interested in what I liked, and likes to play cellphone when we are talking. I would say, it is actually very disrespectful, and I don't like to get along with this kind of people.

## Hang Out

In the following day, I invited her to eat food and watch movies after I finish my work. Cause at that time, I still do not know Whether I like her or not, I want to learn more about her, but after I meet her for second time, she seems changed, totally not the type I liked. In a word, we found a place to eat, and she looked unhappy, always fiddling with her phone... and ...

## Summary

Make a long story short, we end up meeting with each after our second date, not date exactly. The main reason is that I do not like her, and so she is. I think she may watched too many TV series in Korean, and still being not mature. In fact, we do have nothing in common, the things she likes most in her university period is gambling, and I do not gamble at all. I would say it is definitely a waste of time, and cannot benefit me. In addition, I like reading, and she seems not. She even did not finish her undergraduate study...
