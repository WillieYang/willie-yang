Recently, I have watched a Japanese Film, and I do have some personal strange feeling. In this article, I would express some of my opinions briefly, and hope that it could be helpful.  

## About the Movie

Indeed, it has been a long time that I did not watch such kind of movies. However, what I have to say is that, it is actually one of the best movies I have watched in the nearly 1 year, not only about its original sound track, but also the plot, the acting skills of actors, and the tone of film.

## Main Plot

As a matter of fact, this movie truly digs the darkest part of human beings, it started by telling that a mother is abusing her own daughter, and it causes the death of the  little girl. After that, a lots of things happened, and the result has become unpredictable.

## Personal Reflection

Frankly, the reason why I like this movie is that, I cannot comprehend the whole story until last minute before its termination. Besides, in this movie, we cannot tell who is lying and who is not. In addition, what attracted me most is the good timing background music when necessary, it is such blue, deep and dark.
