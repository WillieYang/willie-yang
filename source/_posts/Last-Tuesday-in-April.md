As a matter of fact, it has been three weeks passed that I did not write some words on this blog, and I do not know what to say...

Oh my, time passed so quick, and it is May 6 now, which means that my birthday has been passed. So many things happens in these days.

### Summary

In this Mouth, I have signed the contract about estate, and it might be good for my future wellbeings. And I still go on my career in the Gisuni, and it is good, as temporarily. Cause everyone in this corporation is kind, but the amount of what I still need to learn is infinite. However, I am glad to recognize that, for life is a tour with tears and happiness, and we need to bear it.
