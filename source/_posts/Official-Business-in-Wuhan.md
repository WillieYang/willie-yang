Well, it is actually my first time to go on a business related travel, from Chengdu City to Wuhan City, and I am excited now.

## Day One

### Experience

In this period, I have heard a bunch of terms about GIS and Infrastructure, and I have to say that, it is a bit of boring, cause I do know little about these stuffs, and lacking of interesting.

## Day Two

### Experience

Today, I have made a speech in front all of my department, and it actually cheers me up, I have showed what I have learned, and my working style.

### Out of Work

Recently, I have chatted with a girl for almost fortnight, suddenly, I feel that I might fall in love with her. It is actually a weird feeling, cause, it is the first time, the first time, that, I have that feeling, not sure why. 

### Extra

Google Engine, it might be interesting.

## Day Three

Today, there are many different techs have been discussed in the morning section, but it still need time to learn about and study.
