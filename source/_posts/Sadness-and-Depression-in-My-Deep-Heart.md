As a matter of fact, in the past week, I always feel not right inside my deep heart, I mean, I always feel not good and become depressed. As for the reason, cause there are so many bullshit bothers me to a large degree. To express my true feelings, so that I can get the bad temper out of my chest as soon as possible. I would illustrate what has happened to me in these days specifically. Although, there might be no one here to find what I have wrote. However, it still can help me out of current situation more or less.


## Estate Purchasing

### What I Thought

It is actually a very big deal for who I am now, to buy such a apartment in Chengdu City, China, 2018. If I do it right now, it means that I would be responsible for a house loan which would last for 30 years. Indeed, I did not think about this issue until now, cause I think I already have a small flat to live. However, in the perspective of my family, it seems not enough for me, and my future wife, to live a comfortable life. 

### Final Decision

In fact, I have considered this problem for four or five days, and I realize that I do need to buy such a house for my future wellbeing. Yes, I have made such decision. And I would try my best to achieve this goal. I swear...

## Relationship with Female

### Recent Experience

Last Saturday, I have hung out with my brother to sing songs in Karaoke, and watch movies in the Theater. Indeed, what surprised my most is that there along with a strange girl with my brother's girl friend, which is actually very beautiful. After that, in about seven hours, I behave like a silly boy, always silence, afraid to look at her, and trying to find topic to talk about. I don't know why, and it is truly weird, for her appearance? I am not sure. I think it is because of my nature, it seems easy for me to fall into a relationship without signs. How to avoid it? It is actually a problem. 

### Pressure from My Mother

My mother, always wanna to introduce me a girl friend from her old friends, but, it is actually, I mean, I feel a bit of uncomfortable, cause, it seems like a blind date, and the trade off is about materials rather than feelings, but, I am not sure whether it is right or not. I do need to find a girl who can listen to my words, and support me when I feel depressed. But it is actually hard to find that kind of girl. Time has changed, and people is different.
